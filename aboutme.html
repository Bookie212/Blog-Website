          <h2>My name is Nancy and living the simple life saved my life</h3>

            <p>
            <span>I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. <br>
            <br>
            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. 
            </p>
  
            <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
  
            <p>
              <span>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. <br>
              <br>
              It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
            </p>
  
            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
  
            <p>
              Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. <br>
              <br>
              With how much it turned my life around, <span>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</span> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
